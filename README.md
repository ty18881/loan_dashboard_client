# Customer Assistance Program - Deferral Application Dashboard

# SEIR-FLEX-123  Project Number Four - May 2020
This project simualates a leadership dashboard that would be used to track
applications for loan payment deferrals coming into our fictional bank.

## This project utilizes the following technologies under the hood:
- React
- Ruby
- Rails
- Postgresql
- Chart.js
- Faker on the backend to create simulated loan data

## The application URL

## Future Refinements
- Use Rails Active Record dependencies more elegantly, especially for creating loans attached to deferral applications.
- Leverage Context to avoid passing props down multiple component levels.

## Wireframes
Placeholder while I figure out how to get the images up here.
